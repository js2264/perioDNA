  abstract = "Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosome particles that
              occlude the DNA from interacting with most DNA binding proteins.
              Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular DNA sequences,
              reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as
              required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known
              whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence
              on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of
              other proteins to DNA. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound
              sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences
              in a new computational approach to construct and validate
              experimentally a nucleosome-DNA interaction model, and to predict
              the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results
              demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome
              organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain
              ,50\% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome
              positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions
              including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation,
              and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves. Eukaryotic
              genomic DNA exists as highly compacted nucleosome arrays called
              chromatin. Each nucleosome contains a 147-base-pair (bp) stretch
              of DNA, which is sharply bent and tightly wrapped around a
              histone protein octamer 1. This sharp bending occurs at every DNA
              helical repeat (,10 bp), when the major groove of the DNA faces
              inwards towards the histone octamer, and again ,5 bp away, with
              opposite direction, when the major groove faces outward. Bends of
              each direction are facilitated by specific dinucleo-tides 2,3.
              Neighbouring nucleosomes are separated from each other by
              10-50-bp-long stretches of unwrapped linker DNA 4 ; thus, 75-90\%
              of genomic DNA is wrapped in nucleosomes. Access to DNA wrapped
              in a nucleosome is occluded 1 for polymerase, regulatory, repair
              and recombination complexes, yet nucleosomes also recruit other
              proteins through interactions with their histone tail domains 5.
              Thus, the detailed locations of nucleosomes along the DNA may
              have important inhibitory or facilitatory roles 6,7 in regulating
              gene expression. DNA sequences differ greatly in their ability to
              bend sharply 2,3,8. Consequently, the ability of the histone
              octamer to wrap differing DNA sequences into nucleosomes is
              highly dependent on the specific DNA sequence 9,10. In vitro
              studies show this range of affinities to be 1,000-fold or greater
              11. Thus, nucleosomes have substantial DNA sequence preferences.
              A key question is whether genomes use these sequence preferences
              to control the distribution of nucleosomes in vivo in a way that
              strongly impacts on the ability of DNA binding proteins to access
              particular binding sites. By controlling binding site
              accessibility in this way, genomes could, for example, target the
              binding of transcription factors towards appropriate sites and
              away from irrelevant, non-functional sites 9. One view is that
              the sequence preferences of nucleosomes might not be meaningful.
              Nucleosome positions might be regulated in cells in trans by the
              abundant 12 ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling complexes 13 ,
              which might override the sequence preferences of nucleosomes and
              move them to new locations whenever needed. Another view,
              however, is that remodelling factors do not themselves determine
              the destinations of the nucleosomes that they mobilize. Rather,
              the remodelling complexes may allow nucleosomes to sample
              alternative positions rapidly, resulting in a thermodynamic
              equilibrium between the nucleosomes and the site-specific DNA
              binding proteins that compete with nucleosomes for occupancy
              along the genome. In this view, nucleosome positions are
              regulated in cis by their intrinsic sequence preferences, which
              would then have significant regulatory roles. In this cis
              regulation model, we expect the genome to encode a nucleosome
              organization, intrinsic to the DNA sequence alone, comprising
              sequences with both low and high affinity for nucleosomes. Many
              of the high-affinity sequences should then be occupied by
              nucleosomes in vivo. Moreover, the detailed distribution of
              nucleosome positions encoded by the genome should significantly
              influence chromosome functions genome-wide. Here we report the
              results of a combined experimental and computational approach to
              detect the DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes and the
              intrinsic nucleosome organization of the genome that these
              preferences dictate. Our findings demonstrate that eukaryotic
              genomes use a nucleosome positioning code, and link the resulting
              nucleosome positions to specific chromosome functions. Validating
              a nucleosome-DNA interaction model To construct a model for
              nucleosome-DNA interactions in yeast (Fig. 1a), we used a
              genome-wide assay to isolate DNA regions that were stably wrapped
              in nucleosomes. Our experimental method maps nucleosomes on the
              yeast genome with greater accuracy than previous approaches,
              resulting in a set of 199 mononucleosome DNA sequences of length
              142-152 bp (Supplementary Fig. 1). We used this collection of
              sequences to construct a probabilistic model that represents the
              DNA sequence preferences of yeast nucleosomes (Supplementary Fig.
              2). Our approach resembles that used for representing the binding
              specificities of transcription factors from a collection of known
              sites, but with two main distinctions: first, in contrast to the
              mononucleotide probability distributions used for ARTICLES",

              organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we
              establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome
              organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million
              immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes (displayed at
              http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the
              organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a
              consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic
              sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The
              +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are
              packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther
              distances from the barrier. We present evidence for a novel 3'
              NFR that is present at >95\% of all genes. 3' NFRs may be
              important for transcription termination and anti-sense
