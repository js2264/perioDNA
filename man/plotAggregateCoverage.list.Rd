\arguments{
\item{x}{several signal tracks (SimpleRleList or CompressedRleList class) 
grouped in a named list}

\item{granges}{a GRanges object or a list of GRanges}

\item{colors}{a vector of colors}

\item{xlab}{x axis label}

\item{ylab}{y axis label}

\item{xlim}{y axis limits}

\item{ylim}{y axis limits}

\item{quartiles}{Which quantiles to use to determine y scale automatically?}

\item{verbose}{Boolean}

\item{bin}{Integer Width of the window to use to smooth values}

\item{plot_central}{Boolean Draw a vertical line at 0}

\item{split_by_granges}{Boolean Facet plots by the sets of GRanges}

\item{split_by_track}{Boolean Facet plots by the sets of signal tracks}

\item{free_scales}{Boolean Should each facet have independent y-axis scales?}

\item{runInParallel}{Boolean Should the plots be computed in parallel using 
mclapply?}

\item{norm}{character Should the signals be normalized 
('none', 'zscore' or 'log2')?}

\item{...}{additional parameters}

A plot of aggregated signals
